Mhack2016
Our team designed a web application, matchpoint, that helps a user find workout and sports buddies with similar skill level and time availability, in the user's school. We understand how busy a student is and how it is hard to schedule a game of tennis or a workout with friends since their schedules don't match yours. This service utilizes the Firebase platform to help a user connect with other students around them. Since we used the Bootstrap platform in our development, this service can be used both on one's mobile phone and laptop. Due to time constraints and inexperience with web development, we were unable to add other features that we intended to, such as facebook and google integration, a group chat service and a better database-sorting algorithm. The hackathon was a great experience and we got to learn a lot. We intend to meet in the future and work on this application further to add features that we weren't able to at the hackathon.
